Automated EDA Pipeline with Batch Processing and XGBoost Analysis
This repository contains a Python script that implements an automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline. It is designed to efficiently process large datasets in batches, optimize memory usage, generate comprehensive EDA reports, and perform model training and interpretation using XGBoost and SHAP.

Features
Batch-Wise Data Processing:
Processes large CSV files in manageable chunks to avoid memory overload.

Data Cleaning & Optimization:

Converts numeric columns to lower-precision types.
Converts object columns to categorical types.
Handles date columns by converting them to datetime and extracting useful features (year, month, day, weekday).
Drops duplicates and fills missing numeric values.
Automated EDA Reports:
Generates interactive HTML reports using Sweetviz.

Data Visualization:
Provides visualizations such as correlation heatmaps and word clouds.

Model Training & Interpretation:

Trains an XGBoost regression model on the processed dataset.
Uses SHAP (with TreeExplainer) to generate summary plots that explain feature importance.
Installation
Ensure you are using Python 3.11.11. Install the required packages using the command below:

bash
Copy
Edit
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sweetviz dtale autoviz wordcloud textblob scikit-learn gensim shap xgboost
Usage
Data Preparation:
Place your CSV file (e.g., your_dataset.csv) in the repository directory or update the file path in the script accordingly.

Batch Processing:
The script reads the CSV file in chunks (using a configurable chunksize), applies data cleaning and type conversion, handles date features, and concatenates the processed chunks into a single DataFrame (df_full).

Automated EDA Report:
A Sweetviz report (sweetviz_report.html) is generated to provide an interactive summary of your dataset.

Visualization & Model Training:

A correlation heatmap is generated using Seaborn on the numeric columns.
An XGBoost regressor is trained using the processed dataset (with the target column specified, e.g., "Value").
SHAP's TreeExplainer is used to produce a summary plot that highlights feature importance.
Running the Script:
Execute the main script with:

bash
Copy
Edit
python auto-eda.py
Repository Structure
auto-eda.py:
